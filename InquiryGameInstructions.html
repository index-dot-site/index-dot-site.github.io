              <h2>Premise</h2>  
                <p>In this game, you start your own business that serves spaghetti. Unfortunately, that has put you hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. The object of the game is to grow your business and pay off your debt.</p>
                <h2>Earning Money</h2>
                <h3>Harvesting ingredients</h3>
                <p>Within the game, you must harvest, cook, and then sell. Harvesting can only be done a limited number of times in an ingame day (each lasting one real-life minute) so you have to wait until the next day when you run out. Harvesting can be done by clicking the wheat.</p>
                <h3>Cooking ingredients</h3>
                <p>To make spaghetti with your wheat, you must gather three pieces of wheat. Then clicking the pan five times will create a product you can sell.</p>
                <h3>Selling</h3>
                <p>Click the moneybag to sell spaghetti. Each one nets you $10. You can only sell one if you have one ready (harvested and cooked)</p>
                <h2>Stocks</h2>
                <p>The buy and sell buttons allow you to buy/sell a stock at the current price. It also show the current price as well as the highest and lowest encountered price.</p>
                <h2>Paying debt</h2>
                <p>Click the "Pay Debt" button when you have enough.</p>
